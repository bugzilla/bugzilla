Due to some errors with the 5.0.5 and 5.0.6 releases, which contained
intrusive commits that should not have been made on a stable branch,
this branch has been retired.

If you came from 5.0.4 or earlier, you can continue on the 5.0.4 branch to get
releases 5.0.4.1 and later by using the following command:
   git checkout 5.0.4

If you came from 5.0.5 or 5.0.6 (the fact you're reading this means this is
probably you), you can continue on the 5.2 branch and pick up where this
branch left off by using the following command:
   git checkout 5.2
