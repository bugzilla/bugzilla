Each bug in JitterBug is stored as a text file named by the bug number.
Additions to the bug are indicated by suffixes to this:

<bug>
<bug>.followup.*
<bug>.reply.*
<bug>.notes

The dates on the files represent the respective dates they were created/added.

All <bug>s and <bug>.reply.*s include RFC 822 mail headers. These could include
MIME file attachments as well that would need to be extracted.

There are other additions to the file names, such as

<bug>.notify

which are ignored.

Bugs in JitterBug are organized into directories. At Basis we used the following
naming conventions:

<product>-bugs         Open bugs
<product>-requests     Open Feature Requests
<product>-resolved     Bugs/Features marked fixed by engineering, but not verified
<product>-verified     Resolved defects that have been verified by QA

where <product> is either:

<product-name>

or

<product-name>-<version>
