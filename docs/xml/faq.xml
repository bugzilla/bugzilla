	    Who maintains Bugzilla?

	<answer>
	  <para>
	    A

      led by Dave Miller (justdave@bugzilla.org).

	<question id="faq-general-compare">
	  <para>
	    How does Bugzilla stack up against other bug-tracking databases?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
	    other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please
      get in touch. However, from the author's personal
	    experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored
	    queries, email integration, and platform independence),
	    improved scalability, open source code, greater
	    flexibility, and superior ease-of-use.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you happen to be a commercial bug-tracker vendor, please
	    step forward with a list of advantages your product has over
      Bugzilla. We'd be happy to include it in the "Competitors"
      section.

      <qandaentry>
	<question id="faq-general-bzmissing">
	  <para>
	    Why doesn't Bugzilla offer this or that feature or compatibility
	    with this other tracking software?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it.  Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in
	    usability, customizability, scalability, and user interface.  It
	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source
	    bug-tracking software in existence.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    That doesn't mean it can't use improvement!
	    You can help the project along by either hacking a patch yourself
	    that supports the functionality you require, or else submitting a
	    "Request for Enhancement" (RFE) using the bug submission interface
	    at <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla">bugzilla.mozilla.org</ulink>.

	<question id="faq-general-mysql">
	  <para>
	    Why MySQL?  I'm interested in seeing Bugzilla run on
	    Oracle/Sybase/Msql/PostgreSQL/MSSQL.
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
            MySQL was originally chosen because it is free, easy to install,
            and was available for the hardware Netscape intended to run it on.
	  </para>
          <para>
            There is currently work in progress to make Bugzilla work on
            PostgreSQL and Sybase in the default distribution.  You can track
            the progress of these initiatives in bugs <ulink
            url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98304">98304</ulink>
            and <ulink
            url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=173130">173130</ulink>
            respectively.
          </para>
          <para>
            Once both of these are done, adding support for additional
            database servers should be trivial.

	<question id="faq-general-bonsaitools">
	  <para>
	    Why do the scripts say
            <filename>/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl</filename> instead of
	    <filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename> or something else?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	     Mozilla.org used <filename>/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl</filename>,
             because originally Terry wanted a place to put a version of Perl
             and other tools that was strictly under his control. 
          </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              This convention was abonded during the 2.17 development cycle so

	    Is Bugzilla web-based, or do you have to have specific software or

	  <para>
	    It is web and e-mail based.  You can edit bugs by sending specially

	  <para>
	    Absolutely!  You can track any number of Products that can each be
            composed of any number of Components.
	  </para>
          <note>
            <para>There are only 55 groups available in version 2.16 of
            Bugzilla. If you are using product groups, this will also limit
            the number of products you can have. This limit does not exist in
            the current 2.17 development releases and will not exist in 2.18.

	<question id="faq-phb-sorting">

	    Bugzilla list them for me and allow me to sort by project, severity etc?

	<question id="faq-phb-attachments">
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow attachments (text, screenshots, URLs etc)? If yes,
	    are there any that are NOT allowed?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes - any sort of attachment is allowed, although administrators can
      configure a maximum size.  
            Bugzilla gives the user the option of either using the MIME-type
            supplied by the browser, choosing from a pre-defined list or
            manually typing any arbitrary MIME-type. 
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question id="faq-phb-priorities">
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow us to define our own priorities and levels? Do we
	    have complete freedom to change the labels of fields and format of them, and
	    the choice of acceptable values?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug
	    progression states, also require adjusting the program logic to
	    compensate for the change.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    There is no GUI for adding fields to Bugzilla at this
	    time.  You can follow development of this feature at
	    <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91037"/>.

	<question id="faq-phb-reporting">
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla provide any reporting features, metrics, graphs, etc? You
	    know, the type of stuff that management likes to see. :)
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  Look at <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/reports.cgi"/>
	    for samples of what Bugzilla can do in reporting and graphing.
	  </para>
	  <para>
            If you can not get the reports you want from the included reporting
            scripts, it is possible to hook up a professional reporting package
            such as Crystal Reports using ODBC. If you choose to do this,
            beware that giving direct access to the database does contain some
            security implications. Even if you give read-only access to the
            bugs database it will bypass the secure bugs features of Bugzilla.
	  </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              Bugzilla's current development versions can do a lot more in the
              way of reporting. To see examples, check out
              <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/report.cgi"/>.

	  <para>
	    Is there email notification and if so, what do you see when you get an
	    email?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Email notification is user-configurable.  By default, the bug id and 
      Summary of the bug report accompany each email notification, along with
	    a list of the changes made.

	  <para>
	    Do users have to have any particular

	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Bugzilla email is sent in plain text, the most compatible mail format
	    on the planet.
	    <note>
	      <para>
		If you decide to use the bugzilla_email integration features
		to allow Bugzilla to record responses to mail with the associated bug,
		you may need to caution your users to set their mailer to "respond
		to messages in the format in which they were sent".  For security reasons
		Bugzilla ignores HTML tags in comments, and if a user sends HTML-based
		email into Bugzilla the resulting comment looks downright awful.

	<question id="faq-phb-data">
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had outsiders
	    write up a bug report using a MS Word bug template, could that template be
	    imported into "matching" fields? If I wanted to take the results of a query
	    and export that data to MS Excel, could I do that?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
          <para>
            Bugzilla can only output buglists as HTML in version 2.16. There
            are other formats available (CSV and RDF) in the newer development
            versions.
          </para>
          <para>
            Bugzilla can export bugs using <filename>xml.cgi</filename> with
            either a bug number or list of bug numbers.
          </para>
          <para>
            Currently the only script included with Bugzilla that can import
            data is <filename>importxml.pl</filename> which is intended to be
            used for importing the data generated by <filename>xml.cgi</filename>
            in association with bug moving. Any other use is left as an
            exercise for the user.
          </para>
          <para>
            There are also scripts included in the <filename>contrib/</filename>
            directory for using e-mail to import information into Bugzilla,
            but these scripts are not currently supported and included for
            educational purposes.

            The admin interfaces are still not included in these translated

	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>

                  For the database, there's a number of options - see the

                  is to just make a physical copy of the database on the disk,
                  but you have to have the database server shut down to do

          <para>
            Why do users have to log in every time they access a page? This
            affects everyone who accesses my Bugzilla. (If this only affects
            some of your users, see the next FAQ item.)
          </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>
            The most-likely cause is that the "cookiepath" parameter is not set
            correctly in the Bugzilla configuration.  You can change this (if
            you're a Bugzilla administrator) from the editparams.cgi page
            via the web.
          </para>
          <para>
            The value of the cookiepath parameter should be the actual directory
            containing your Bugzilla installation, <emphasis>as seen by the
            end-user's web browser</emphasis>. Leading and trailing slashes are
            mandatory. You can also set the cookiepath to any directory which
            is a parent of the Bugzilla directory (such as '/', the root
            directory). But you can't put something that isn't at least
            a partial match or it won't work. What you're actually doing
            is restricting the end-user's browser to sending the cookies
            back only to that directory.
          </para>
          <para>
            How do you know if you want your specific Bugzilla directory or the
            whole site?
          </para>

          <para>
            If you have only one Bugzilla running on the server, and you
            don't mind having other applications on the same server with it
            being able to see the cookies (you might be doing this on purpose
            if you have other things on your site that share authentication with
            Bugzilla), then you'll want to have the cookiepath set to "/", or to
            a sufficiently-high enough directory that all of the involved apps
            can see the cookies.
          </para>
          <para>
            Examples:

            <blockquote>

        cookiepath is /

        urlbase is <ulink url="http://tools.mysite.tld/bugzilla/"/>
                but you have http://tools.mysite.tld/someotherapp/ which shares
                authentication with your Bugzilla
        cookiepath is /
              </literallayout>
            </blockquote>
          </para>
          
         <para>
            On the other hand, if you have more than one Bugzilla
            running on the server (some people do - we do on landfill)
            then you need to have the cookiepath restricted enough
            so that the different Bugzillas don't
            confuse their cookies with one another.
          </para>
          <para>
            Examples:

            <blockquote>
              <literallayout>

        cookiepath is /bugzilla-tip/

        urlbase is <ulink url="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-2.16-branch/"/>
        cookiepath is /bugzilla-2.16-branch/
              </literallayout>
            </blockquote>
          </para>

          <para>
            If you had cookiepath set to / at any point in the past and
            need to set it to something more restrictive (i.e. /bugzilla/),
            you can safely do this without requiring users to delete
            their Bugzilla-related cookies in their browser (this is
            true starting with Bugzilla 2.17.7 and Bugzilla 2.16.5).

            If that doesn´t fix the problem, it may be that
            the user´s ISP implements a rotating proxy server. This causes
            the user´s effective IP address (the address which the Bugzilla server
            perceives him coming from) to change periodically. Since
            Bugzilla cookies are tied to a specific IP address, each time
            the effective address changes, the user will have to log in again.
          </para>
          <para>
            In newer versions of Bugzilla (2.17.1 and later) there is a
            parameter called "loginnetmask", which you can use to set the
            number of bits of the user's IP address to require to be matched
            when authenticating the cookies. If you set this to something less
            than 32, then the user will be given a checkbox for "Restrict this
            login to my IP address" on the login screen, which defaults to
            checked. If they leave the box checked, Bugzilla will behave the
            same as it did before, requiring an exact match on their IP address
            to remain logged in. If they uncheck the box, then only the left
            side of their IP address (up to the number of bits you specified in
            the parameter) has to match to remain logged in.

	    CGI's are failing with a "something.cgi is not a valid Windows NT

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure
	    the Web server to treat *.cgi files as CGI scripts. In IIS, you do this by
	    adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with the &lt;path&gt;\perl.exe %s %s as the
	    executable.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Microsoft has some advice on this matter, as well:
	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		"Set application mappings. In the ISM, map the extension for the script
		file(s) to the executable for the script interpreter. For example, you might
		map the extension .py to Python.exe, the executable for the Python script
		interpreter. Note For the ActiveState Perl script interpreter, the extension
		.pl is associated with PerlIS.dll by default. If you want to change the
		association of .pl to perl.exe, you need to change the application mapping.
		In the mapping, you must add two percent (%) characters to the end of the
		pathname for perl.exe, as shown in this example: c:\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s"

      <para>
        The logic flow currently used is RESOLVED, then VERIFIED, then CLOSED.
        You <emphasis>can</emphasis> mass-CLOSE bugs from the change several
        bugs at once page. <emphasis>but</emphasis>, every bug listed on the
        page has to be in VERIFIED state before the control to do it will show
        up on the form. You can also mass-VERIFY, but every bug listed has to be
        RESOLVED in order for the control to show up on the form. The logic
        behind this is that if you pick one of the bugs that's not VERIFIED and
        try to CLOSE it, the bug change will fail miserably (thus killing any
        changes in the list after it while doing the bulk change) so it doesn't
