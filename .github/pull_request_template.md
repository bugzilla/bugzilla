#### Instructions

1. All pull requests to an officially supported branch must be accompanied by a bug report on bugzilla.mozilla.org. Please stop and file one there if you haven't already, or look for an existing one that fits what you're doing (the bug entry form will automatically search for things that look similar to the Summary you enter).
   File a bug report: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla
2. GitHub will automatically attach your pull request to the bug report in Bugzilla if you have "Bug #######" in the title of the pull request, where ####### is the bug number. For readability, we recommend putting it at the beginning of the title.
3. If it's not otherwise obvious from the title which branch the pull request applies to, please put the name of the branch in square brackets at the beginning of the title.
