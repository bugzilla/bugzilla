Template hooks go in this directory. Template hooks are called in normal
Bugzilla templates like [% Hook.process('some-hook') %].
More information about them can be found in the documentation of 
Bugzilla::Extension. (Do "perldoc Bugzilla::Extension" from the main
Bugzilla directory to see that documentation.)
