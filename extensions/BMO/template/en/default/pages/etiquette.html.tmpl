<h2>Bugzilla Etiquette</h2>

<p>
  It is our intention that [% terms.Bugzilla %] remains a useful tool for reporting
  and commenting on [% terms.bugs %], feature-requests, and tasks for the Mozilla community.
  In order to keep [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] a useful, inclusive place for this work, we have
  guidelines for using this site which, by using this site, you agree to follow.
  In addition, your participation on this site is also subject to
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation">Mozilla's participation guidelines</a>.
  Violations of [% terms.Bugzilla %] etiquette or Mozilla's participation guidelines will be considered
  as grounds for suspending your privileges on this site, or suspend your account altogether.
</p>

<h3>Commenting</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span class="heading">No abusing people</span>.
    Constant and intense critique is one of the reasons we build great products.
    It's harder to fall into group-think if there is always a healthy amount of
    dissent. We want to encourage vibrant debate inside of the Mozilla
    community, we want you to disagree with us, and we want you to effectively
    argue your case. However, we require that in the process, you criticize
    <i>things</i>, not <i>people</i>. Examples of things include: interfaces,
    algorithms, and schedules. Examples of people include: developers,
    designers and users. <b>Attacking or encouraging attacks on a person
    may result in you being banned from [% terms.Bugzilla %]</b>.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No obligation</span>.
    "Open Source" is not the same as "the developers must do my bidding."
    Everyone here wants to help, but no one else has any <i>obligation</i> to fix
    the [% terms.bugs %] you want fixed. Therefore, you should not act as if you
    expect someone to fix a [% terms.bug %] by a particular date or release.
    Aggressive or repeated demands will not be received well and will almost
    certainly diminish the impact and interest in your suggestions.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No spam</span>.
    Posting comment spam will lead to the supsension of your account.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No pointless comments</span>.
    Limit comments on a [% terms.bug %] to information which will help with
    resolving it. Unless requested, additional "I see this too" or "It works for me"
    comments are unnecessary unless they are on a different platform or a significantly
    different build.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No private email</span>.
    Do not send comments to [% terms.bugs %] by private email; no-one else can read
    them if you do that, and they'll be missed and/or ignored. If an attachment
    is too big for [% terms.Bugzilla %], add a comment giving the file size and contents
    and ask what to do.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changing Fields</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <span class="heading">No messing with other people's [% terms.bugs %]</span>.
    Unless you are the [% terms.bug %] assignee, or have some say over the use of their
    time, never change the Priority or Target Milestone fields. If in doubt,
    do not change the fields of [% terms.bugs %] you do not own - add a comment
    instead, suggesting the change.
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="heading">No whining about decisions</span>.
    If another project contributor has marked a [% terms.bug %] as INVALID, then it is
    invalid. Filing another duplicate of it does not change this. Unless
    you have further evidence to support this, do not post a comment arguing that an
    INVALID or WONTFIX [% terms.bug %] should be reopened.
  </li>

</ol>

  If you observe, or are the subject of behavior in violation of these guidelines, please tag
  the [% terms.bug %] or comment following our <a href="page.cgi?id=anti-abuse.html">anti-abuse policy</a>.
