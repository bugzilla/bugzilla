Normal templates go in this directory. You can load them in your
code like this:

use Bugzilla::Error;
my $template = Bugzilla->template;
$template->process('openldapsec/some-template.html.tmpl')
  or ThrowTemplateError($template->error());

That would be how to load a file called <kbd>some-template.html.tmpl</kbd> that
was in this directory.

Note that you have to be careful that the full path of your template
never conflicts with a template that exists in Bugzilla or in 
another extension, or your template might override that template. That's why
we created this directory called 'openldapsec' for you, so you
can put your templates in here to help avoid conflicts.
